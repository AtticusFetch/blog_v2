            <div class="hiddenContent" id="aboutContent">Angus Young was born on March 31, 1955 in Glasgow, Scotland.
                At school, Angus was an unenthusiastic student. His only real academic interest was art wich allowed
                him some freedom of expression. He gave up school at 15 and went to work for a soft porn magazine
                called Ribald as a printer. But his ambitions laid elsewhere anyway, and for a year prior to leaving
                school Angus had been practising guitar almost constantly, jamming around with friends and playing at
                school dances.</div>
